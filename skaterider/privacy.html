    <section class="markdown-body">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The sole proprietorship Hugo Jean Didier DEL PIA (hereinafter referred to as "we"), publisher of the mobile application <em>Skate Rider</em>, places great importance on user privacy.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your game-related data in compliance with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> and other applicable regulations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="markdown-body">
        <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Login Identifiers:</strong> When you log in via your Google or Apple account, we receive a unique user identifier provided by these services. This identifier allows us to create your game profile. <em>We do not access your personal information such as your real name, email address, or contacts.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> We store information related to your use of the application, including <strong>scores, levels reached, rewards, achievements,</strong> and other game statistics. These data are associated with your player profile (via the unique identifier) to save your progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Profile/Pseudonym:</strong> If a pseudonym or avatar is used in the game (e.g., your Google Play Games or Apple Game Center profile name), it may be collected to display your scores in leaderboards. No other profile details are retrieved without permission.</li>
            <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us for support or feedback (e.g., via email), we may retain the information you voluntarily provide (such as your email address and the content of your request) to respond and track your inquiry.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> If you grant location permission, we may collect your approximate (or precise, if enabled) geographic location. This data is used <strong>only for in-game features</strong> such as unlocking location-based skins or participating in city battles. Location data is never stored permanently nor used for marketing or tracking purposes. You can disable it anytime in your device settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> The Application uses third-party ad networks (e.g., Google AdMob or IronSource) to display <strong>rewarded and interstitial ads.</strong> These services may collect advertising identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID or Apple IDFA) in accordance with their own privacy policies to deliver and measure ads. We do not have access to this information ourselves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No other data is collected without your knowledge. Specifically, <em>Skate Rider</em> does not collect <strong>contact lists, photos, or any other personal information stored on your device.</strong> The application also does not use cookies except for technical identifiers required for functionality (such as Google/Apple authentication SDKs).</p>

        <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>The application is not intended for children under the age of 13. Consequently, we do not knowingly collect personal data from users below this age. If we discover that a child under 13 (or the minimum required age by local law) has provided us with personal information, we will take appropriate measures to delete such data. Additionally, using Google/Apple login requires the user to comply with the minimum age set by these services.</p>
        <p>Advertising is limited to general-audience ads. <em>Skate Rider</em> is not directed to children under 13, and we do not request or display personalized advertising to minors.</p>

        <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>The collected data is used strictly for <strong>game functionality and service improvement.</strong> Specifically, we use your data to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide the gaming service:</strong> Your login identifiers and game data enable us to <strong>create and manage your player account,</strong> save your progress, and display your scores and achievements.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaderboards and Interaction:</strong> Your scores and pseudonym may be used to generate <strong>leaderboards</strong> or other social features within the application, allowing you to compare your performance with other players. Only non-personal data (game pseudonym and score) is visible to other users.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Improvement:</strong> Aggregate and anonymized game statistics (e.g., most played levels, average scores) may be analyzed to <strong>enhance the gaming experience,</strong> balance difficulty, or fix potential bugs. No personal data is analyzed.</li>
            <li><strong>Support and Communication:</strong> If you contact us for support, we will use your contact information and message content <strong>exclusively to assist you</strong> (e.g., resolve technical issues) and improve our services where applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your data for any other purposes than those described above. Specifically, <em>Skate Rider</em> <strong>does not perform commercial profiling or advertising targeting</strong> based on your data, and <strong>does not send unsolicited marketing communications.</strong></p>

            <li><strong>Authentication Providers:</strong> <em>Skate Rider</em> relies on <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> services for user authentication.

            <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose certain data if required by law or in response to a valid legal request (e.g., a court order or law enforcement request).

            <li><strong>Advertising Partners:</strong> We integrate advertising services (e.g., Google AdMob, IronSource) to display ads and reward videos. These partners may use identifiers and cookies to personalize or measure ads, in accordance with their own privacy policies. You can review and manage your ad preferences from your device settings or the in-app privacy options.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outside of these cases, <strong>none of your data is shared with third parties.</strong> Specifically, we do not exchange data with other publishers or advertisers.</p>
