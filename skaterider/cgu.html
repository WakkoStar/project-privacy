        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>These <strong>Terms of Use</strong> (hereinafter “<strong>Terms</strong>”) define the conditions and rules for using the mobile application <em>Skate Rider</em> (hereinafter the "<strong>Application</strong>"), published by <strong>Hugo Jean Didier DEL PIA</strong> (hereinafter the "<strong>Publisher</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>"), available on iOS and Android devices.</p>
        <p>By installing and using the Application, <strong>you accept these Terms without reservation.</strong> If you disagree with any of the rules set forth below, please do not use the Application.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> As <em>Skate Rider</em> is distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, its use also implies compliance with the <strong>terms of use of these platforms</strong> (including Google/Apple account rules). You must have a valid account on one of these platforms to log in to <em>Skate Rider</em>.</p>

        <h2>2. Access to the Application and User Account</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Registration and Login:</strong> <em>Skate Rider</em> allows simplified registration via <strong>Google</strong> or <strong>Apple</strong> authentication. Upon first use, you will need to log in using your Google Play or Game Center account. Once authenticated, a <strong>player profile</strong> will be automatically created for you in the Application. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Google/Apple credentials. We are not liable for any unauthorized access to your external account (Google/Apple) and its consequences within the Application.</li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy of Information:</strong> You guarantee that the information in your game profile is accurate. If the Application allows you to choose a pseudonym or avatar, you agree not to impersonate a third party or use any terms that violate public order and good morals (e.g., offensive or illegal pseudonyms). The Publisher reserves the right to remove or modify any non-compliant pseudonym.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum Age Requirement:</strong> By accepting these Terms, you confirm that you meet the <strong>minimum legal age requirement</strong> to use a Google or Apple account (usually at least 13 years old, or more depending on local regulations). If you are between 13 and 18 years old (a minor in some jurisdictions), you certify that you use the Application with the consent of a parent or guardian. The Publisher reserves the right to suspend any account found to belong to a user below the required age.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Requirements:</strong> To use <em>Skate Rider</em>, you must have a <strong>compatible device</strong> (smartphone or tablet) and a functioning internet connection. Any connectivity costs (mobile data, Wi-Fi) are your responsibility. The Application is provided for free (except for potential in-app purchases). We do not guarantee the Application’s functionality on devices that have been modified in unauthorized ways (e.g., jailbroken or rooted) or on outdated operating system versions.</li>
            <li><strong>Updates:</strong> To ensure optimal operation and security, <strong>updates</strong> may be required. It is your responsibility to keep the Application up to date. The Publisher is not responsible for malfunctions or incompatibilities resulting from failure to update. We also reserve the right to <strong>suspend or discontinue the Application</strong> on app stores (e.g., if the app is withdrawn, service is discontinued, or there is extended maintenance), and you will be informed whenever possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
        <p>The Application <em>Skate Rider</em> is made available for <strong>recreational and personal use</strong>. As a user, you agree to use the Application responsibly and <strong>in accordance with applicable laws</strong> as well as these Terms. Specifically, you are <strong>strictly prohibited</strong> from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Misusing the game:</strong> Do not use the Application for purposes other than personal entertainment. You are not authorized to commercially exploit <em>Skate Rider</em>, use it to promote third-party content without permission, or use it in any way not intended by the Publisher.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheating or manipulating the game:</strong> Any form of <strong>cheating, use of unauthorized software, scripts, bots, or modification of the code</strong> is prohibited. You agree not to bypass game mechanics (scores, leaderboards, rewards) or security measures. Exploiting bugs to your advantage is also forbidden—you are encouraged to report any vulnerabilities found.</li>
            <li><strong>Server or service disruption:</strong> Do not attempt to <strong>attack, overload, or interfere with</strong> the servers, networks, or infrastructure of <em>Skate Rider</em>. This includes hacking attempts, flooding, virus deployment, denial-of-service attacks, or any action that harms the availability and stability of the Application.</li>
            <li><strong>Illegal or inappropriate content:</strong> You must not <strong>transmit or share any content</strong> that is abusive, defamatory, obscene, threatening, or illegal via the Application. While <em>Skate Rider</em> primarily handles game data (scores, etc.) and does not feature discussion forums, this rule applies to your chosen pseudonym and any possible in-game interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> You may not <strong>copy, extract, modify, decompile, disassemble, or reverse-engineer</strong> the Application's source code or content unless explicitly permitted by law. You are also prohibited from reproducing or redistributing game elements (graphics, texts, sounds, designs, etc.) without express authorization.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-account abuse:</strong> Unless expressly authorized by the Publisher, creating multiple accounts to bypass limitations or gain an unfair advantage (e.g., farming rewards) is prohibited. If detected, we reserve the right to suspend the offending accounts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Liability and Limitations</h2>
        <p>The Publisher disclaims all liability for any direct or indirect damages arising from the use or inability to use the Application <em>Skate Rider</em>. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Application is provided <strong>"as is"</strong>, without any guarantees of error-free or uninterrupted service.</li>
            <li>We are not liable for <strong>device damage or data loss</strong> related to the use of the Application.</li>
            <li>The Application may contain links or services from third parties (e.g., Google/Apple authentication). We have no control over these services and assume no responsibility for their functioning or content.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="markdown-body">
    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the extent permitted by law, the Publisher disclaims all liability for direct or indirect damages that may arise from the use or inability to use the <em>Skate Rider</em> application. By installing and using the Application, you understand and accept the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Availability and Quality:</strong> <em>Skate Rider</em> is provided “as is.” We strive to offer a high-quality and continuously available service, but we do not guarantee that the Application will be error-free or uninterrupted. Outages, bugs, or temporary unavailability may occur (e.g., maintenance, updates, network issues beyond our control). The user acknowledges that interruptions may occur and agrees not to hold the Publisher responsible for any consequences (such as lost game progress).</li>
        <li><strong>Device or Data Damage:</strong> The Publisher shall not be liable for any material damage or data loss related to the use of the Application. You are responsible for protecting your device (antivirus, system updates) and making regular backups. Additionally, <em>Skate Rider</em> applies only a normal software load on hardware; in case of overheating or other hardware damage, our liability cannot be engaged unless otherwise required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Links and Services:</strong> The Application may integrate third-party elements or services, such as authentication via Google/Apple or external links (e.g., community pages). We do not control these third-party services and disclaim all liability regarding their operation, content, or data usage. Any interaction with a third-party service through <em>Skate Rider</em> (e.g., using your Google/Apple account) is governed by that third party’s terms and privacy policies.</li>
        <li><strong>User Conduct and Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for your behavior in the Application and its usage. The Publisher is not liable for any breach of the Terms or the law on your part, nor for any resulting consequences affecting other users or third parties. For instance, in case of a dispute with another player due to your misconduct, you assume full responsibility for the consequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Limitations:</strong> Nothing in these Terms aims to exclude or limit any statutory rights you may have as a consumer under mandatory laws (e.g., in France, legal warranties on conformity and hidden defects, or liability in case of personal injury). Thus, the above limitations apply only to the extent permitted by law. The Publisher remains liable in cases of proven gross or intentional misconduct or any situation where liability exclusion is legally prohibited.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using <em>Skate Rider</em>, you agree that the Publisher cannot be held liable for indirect damages (such as loss of opportunity, lost profit, loss of external data, commercial harm, etc.) resulting from the use or performance of the Application.</p>

        <h2>6. Sanctions and Account Termination</h2>
        <p>In case of a breach of these Terms or illegal/inappropriate behavior, the Publisher reserves the right to take necessary actions against your account, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Depending on the severity of the violation, we may issue a warning urging compliance with the rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Restrictions:</strong> The Publisher may temporarily or permanently restrict certain account features (e.g., leaderboard exclusion for cheating, event participation suspension).</li>
            <li><strong>Account Suspension/Ban:</strong> For severe or repeated violations, we may suspend or disable your <em>Skate Rider</em> account without notice. This may be temporary or permanent (ban), restricting access to the game or limiting it to certain parts.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Removal:</strong> If you post non-compliant content (e.g., offensive username), the Publisher may delete or modify it without notice. Fraudulently obtained scores (e.g., via cheating) may also be removed.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Actions:</strong> The Publisher may take legal action against the user for law violations (e.g., fraud, hacking attempts, or damage to the Application or servers) and may cooperate with authorities by providing relevant information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users whose accounts are suspended or banned for Terms violations are not entitled to compensation. Temporary suspensions may be lifted at the Publisher's discretion, while permanently banned accounts may have their associated data deleted per the Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>You are free to stop using the Application at any time. You can uninstall <em>Skate Rider</em> from your device. If you wish to request full account and data deletion, please contact us (see Contact section).

        <h2>7. Changes to the Terms</h2>
        <p>The Publisher reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time, particularly due to legal, technical changes, or new features. If significant changes occur, we will notify you appropriately (e.g., in-app notification, message on login).</p>
        <p>The latest version of the Terms will be available in the Application (under “Terms & Conditions” or “Legal Notices”) and on our website if applicable. It is your responsibility to review the Terms regularly to stay informed.</p>
        <p>By continuing to use the Application after the changes take effect, you accept the revised Terms. If you disagree with the new Terms, you must stop using <em>Skate Rider</em> and may request account deletion. Changes are not retroactive; past actions/events remain subject to the Terms in force at the time.</p>

    <section class="markdown-body">
        <h2>8. Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by <strong>French law</strong>. However, this does not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections in your country of residence (e.g., Belgium or Canada). If your country’s laws provide stronger protections, they may apply despite the choice of law.</p>
        <p>For disputes regarding the interpretation or execution of these Terms, we encourage you to contact us first for an amicable resolution. Complaints can be sent via email or postal mail (see Contact section).</p>
        <p><strong>Mediation (for EU consumers):</strong> In accordance with French Consumer Code Articles L.611-1 and following, if you are a consumer and unsatisfied after contacting our support, you may access a free <strong>consumer mediation service</strong>. Details will be provided upon request or on our website.</p>
        <p>Failing an amicable solution, disputes will be subject to the <strong>jurisdiction of the courts where the Publisher's headquarters are located</strong> (except where specific legal provisions grant jurisdiction, particularly for EU consumers who may also file claims in their country of residence).</p>
